CITATIONS:
Makes use of Pandorabot's Python API, included here as pb_py.

Structure:
This module has three main components.
start.js - For us inside our main page to allow us to get responses from the bots
compute_inputpy - Communicates with the pb_py api to allow us to query response from bots we have already generated.

Testing:
Edit the test case at the bottom of 'start.js'. Run 'node start.js' in terminal to observe the results.
